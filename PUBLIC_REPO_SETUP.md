# ðŸš€ Public Repository Setup Guide

## Final Steps for Thesis Submission

### 1. Create New Public Repository

**Recommended Repository Name**: `explainable-ai-credit-underwriting` or `xai-credit-decisions`

**Repository Settings**:
- âœ… Public repository
- âœ… Add README (will be overwritten)
- âœ… Add .gitignore (will be overwritten)
- âœ… Choose appropriate license (MIT recommended for academic work)

### 2. Prepare Current Repository

Your current repository is now clean and ready! Here's what to do:

```bash
# 1. Make sure all changes are committed
git add .
git commit -m "Final cleanup for public release"

# 2. Create a clean branch for public release
git checkout -b public-release

# 3. Remove any remaining sensitive files (if any)
# Check for any files that might contain sensitive data
git log --oneline -10  # Review recent commits
```

### 3. Push to New Public Repository

```bash
# 1. Add your new public repository as a remote
git remote add public https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git

# 2. Push the public-release branch to the new repository
git push public public-release:main

# 3. Set main as default branch in GitHub settings
```

### 4. Final Repository Checklist

Before making public, verify:

- âœ… **No sensitive data**: API keys, personal info, internal project IDs
- âœ… **Clean history**: Only relevant commits for thesis work
- âœ… **Complete documentation**: README, usage examples, methodology
- âœ… **Working code**: All scripts and notebooks should run
- âœ… **Proper .gitignore**: Excludes logs, temp files, sensitive configs
- âœ… **Thesis title**: Updated in README and project description

### 5. Repository Description

**GitHub Repository Description**:
```
Master's Thesis: Explainable AI in Credit Underwriting - Comprehensive framework combining traditional ML models with LLM-generated explanations for credit decision making
```

**Topics/Tags**:
- `explainable-ai`
- `credit-underwriting`
- `machine-learning`
- `llm`
- `shap`
- `counterfactual-explanations`
- `thesis`
- `financial-ai`

### 6. Final Verification

Run these commands to ensure everything is clean:

```bash
# Check for any remaining sensitive files
grep -r "your_project_id\|your_api_key\|sk-\|AIza" . --exclude-dir=.git

# Verify .gitignore is working
git status

# Test that key scripts work
uv run python scripts/predict_batch.py --help
```

### 7. Academic Citation

Once public, others can cite your work as:

```bibtex
@mastersthesis{yourname2024,
  title={Explainable AI in Credit Underwriting: Evaluating LLM-generated Decision Explanations},
  author={[Your Name]},
  year={2024},
  school={[Your University]},
  type={Master's Thesis}
}
```
